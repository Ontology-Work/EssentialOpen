# EssentialOpen
This repository contains a set of scripts designed to run the open-source release of the Essential Project.
The scripts are built to containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to Azure. 
The solution is fully functional, with authentication integrated through Entra ID / Active Directory, providing a secure and scalable environment for enterprise architecture management.
These scripts automate the setup, containerization, and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth transition from local development to cloud deployment.
